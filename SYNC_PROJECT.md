# Fix Android View Missing Issue

## The Problem
The "Android" view option is not showing in the Project dropdown because Android Studio hasn't fully synced the Gradle project.

## Solution

### Option 1: Sync Gradle Files (Recommended)
1. In Android Studio, go to **File → Sync Project with Gradle Files**
2. Wait for the sync to complete
3. The "Android" view should now appear in the Project dropdown

### Option 2: Invalidate Caches and Restart
If Option 1 doesn't work:
1. Go to **File → Invalidate Caches / Restart**
2. Click **Invalidate and Restart**
3. Wait for Android Studio to restart and re-index
4. The "Android" view will be available

### Option 3: Manual Sync
1. Open the Gradle tool window (View → Tool Windows → Gradle)
2. Click the "Sync Project with Gradle Files" button (🔄 icon)
3. Wait for completion

## Why This Happens
- `.iml` files are auto-generated by Gradle sync
- Android Studio needs to recognize the project structure
- The "Android" view only appears after successful Gradle sync

## After Sync
Once synced, you'll see:
- **Android** view option in the dropdown
- Clean project structure showing only `app`, `Gradle Scripts`, etc.
- Proper module recognition
